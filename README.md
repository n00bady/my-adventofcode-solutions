## What is this about.
Late december last year I decided to start from the begining and little by little complete *all* 
advent of code challenges.  
So this is a repo that shows my solutions and my progress.  

Many solutions are hasty and without much though, mainly because I work on them on the side on downtime
or while I am doing other boring things.
